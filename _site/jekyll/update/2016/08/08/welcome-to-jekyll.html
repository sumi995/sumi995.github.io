	<p>This was one of the journeys I took from Kathmandu to a small and almost isolated village called Phidim last summer in Nepal. I was inside a hefty and crowded bus, (only 20 mins into the 24 hour long ride) when I took this footage. Yup. 24 hours. The reason why it takes so long to travel to anywhere in Nepal by road is because of all the hills! The journey takes even longer if there is a landslide or a road accident involved. So basically, you're stuck inside a metal container along with a bunch of anxious strangers for 24 hours, except for the occasional toilet and meal breaks. By no means is this a fancy bus designed to alleviate your discomfort. Open windows are your air conditioner, a bottle of water and a bag of peanuts is all the food you get and unapologetically cheesy songs blare out of speakers (which is why the muted video).</p>


	<p>At the end of this long journey, I was to meet with some friends and family members whom I had only seen once on a previous trip to Phidim when I was 10. What happened when I got to Phidim and how my perspective had changed after almost 10 years is a completely different topic for another blog post.</p>

	<p>Speaking of blog posts, this is my new blog for a new year. This will hopefully be a place where I can share some ideas, talk about what's on my mind and reach out to awesome people like you guys. I'll put up a video with my post, just like I've done for this one, as a visual tidbit. My posts will be miscellaneous, as you probably have already guessed, since I am an amateur of a lot of things and an expert of nothing, yet. The look of website will change until I have figured out a layout that I am happy with.</p>

	<p>I still have to fix some of the tiny bugs like adjusting the fonts and texts with different screen sizes, which will be done in no time. I'll try my best to post frequently. Stay tuned for more miscellaneous!!</p>
