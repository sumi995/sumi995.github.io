	<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you are aware of all the things you need to do, but there is this fog of uncertainty surrounding you that stops you from moving forward or takes you longer to accomplish your goals? Maybe you really need to finish that homework assignment or maybe you want to start working out, and you still don't have the energy to do it.</p>

	<p>By this point you might just shrug it off and say, "I'm just too lazy to do it." However, most of the time, it's because you've simply not paid much attention to the actual problem that is mentally and physically stopping you. You are never truly aware of it until you pull yourself out of the hypnotic trance of everyday life. Sounds trivial, right? But, how many of us actually make a conscious effort to stop and make sense of our situation?</p>
	
	<p>Don't get me wrong. I am not a psychologist. This is just a small observation. We all struggle with this. But what I do know is a tiny solution which is in no way mind blowing or surprising. You probably subconsciously do this every time you have to a make a decision. But, in this case, you can see it physically.</p>
	
	<p>So, take a paper and a pen.<br />
	<b>Step 1.</b> Write down what you need to do.<br />
	<b>Step 2.</b> Draw one or mulitple arrows downwards to point to the reasons why you are unable to do the task.<br />
	<b>Step 3.</b> For each problems/reason, can you find a way to fix it? If yes, then your current problem is solved! Write down the solution and execute the right action. Move to the next reason. If not, repeat  step 2 and step 3 until your answer is yes and you have found a problem that is solvable.</p> 
	
	<p>After that, the problem will neatly fold itself up the steps since that now every problem is solvable. As an example just resume the video!</p>
